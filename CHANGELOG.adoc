* Fix occasional buffer overflow issue on TLS connections.

== v1.1.0 (2019-03-13)

* Away support:
** Added sendAway() method

== v1.0.1 (2019-03-10)

* Fixed issue with very long packets not fitting in buffers
  after TLS decryption.
* Improved error message when IrcClient.connect() is called
  while already connected
* Made IrcClient.disconnect() block until the disconnect has
  been processed. This will be a very short period of time,

  not behaving correctly

  fatal issue when connecting to servers over TLS that request a
  client certificate.

  not allowed during connection and *MUST* be changed
* BREAKING: Added 'PreferIPv6' behaviour config, defaulting to true.
  With this configuration KtIrc will try to use IPv6 if the server
  publishes AAAA records.
* BREAKING: Default port is now 6697, TLS is enabled by default

* Added support for labelled-replies capability and label message tags
* Added support for message-tags capability after it moved from draft
* Added new methods for sending raw lines to the IRC server
** send(tagMap(...), command, arguments) replaces send(line)

  that don't support the echo message capability

* Improve DSL for creating an IrcClient to allow parameters to be passed to server and profile
  e.g. IrcClient { server("irc.example.com", 6667) }
* Add behaviour options
** requestModesOnJoin - automatically sends a MODE request when joining a channel
* Events now have a `metadata` property instead of a `time` (and time is available in metadata)
